## 🚀 Usage

1. **Open a notebook:**
   - Use Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to open `AAPL_volitality.ipynb` or `TSLA_volitality.ipynb`.
2. **Configure parameters:**
   - Update the stock ticker (if needed) and date range at the top of the notebook.
   - Paste your NewsAPI key in the designated cell.
3. **Run the workflow:**
   - Execute cells sequentially to:
     - Download historical stock data (via yfinance)
     - Fetch news headlines (via NewsAPI)
     - Calculate technical indicators
     - Perform sentiment analysis (TextBlob)
     - Train and evaluate volatility prediction models
   - Visualizations and processed data will be generated as output.

## 🌐 API

- **NewsAPI** is required for news sentiment analysis.
- You must obtain your own API key and paste it in the notebook cell:
  ```python
  NEWSAPI_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
  ```
- NewsAPI free tier limits queries to the past 30 days.
- All API calls are handled within the notebook; no server setup required.
